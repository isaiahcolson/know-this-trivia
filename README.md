<h1>Welcome to "Know This", an entertainment trivia game.</h1>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>When viewing the launch screen, you should see 10 categories as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rick and Morty</li>
    <li>Lord of the Rings</li>
    <li>Stranger Things</li>
    <li>Disney</li>
    <li>Marvel Cinematic Universe</li>
    <li>Star Wars</li>
    <li>The Office</li>
    <li>Back to the Future</li>
    <li>Harry Potter</li>
    <li>Simpsons</li>
  </ul>
 <p>There are 10 questions within each category. You won't be able to see if your answer is right or wrong because you should be a master! But if you really want to know, go ahead and open up that console log and it'll show you there.</p>
 <p>After you answer all 10 questions, your score will show on the end screen. If you want, you can go ahead and hit that replay button. It will reset your score and take you back to the first question in that category. You can also press the finish button and you will be taken back to the launch screen to select a new category.</p>
 <p>Enjoy the game! See if you can get all questions correct in each category, I tried to make it as hard as possible for you.</p>
 
 
 <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
 <p>I do not own any of the photos used from film and shows. They are not my property, I have only taken them from sources to use as reference to questions in the categories given. I created all of the background elements that match the design theme.</p>
 <p>This game is also not responsive to different screen sizes. It only fits on a general desktop viewport.</p>
